                    To ensure accuracy when placing orders, please have your customer number or telephone number
                    available. Specify fabric by product number, pattern name and color. All prices shown are net price and
                    are subject to change without notice. Prices are F.O.B. warehouse from North Carolina.

                        <em>Terms</em><br>
                        Regular terms are NET 30 days (date of invoice). All invoices are dated the day of shipment. To
                        establish terms, you are required to provide the names and addresses of five trade references, your
                        company bank account information, your resale number, and a signed credit application. If terms have
                        not been established, orders will be handled on a Proforma or COD basis.

                    <br><br>

                        <em>Conditions</em><br>
                        Red warning labels are attached to each cut and piece of fabric shipped from our warehouse. No
                        credit will be allowed if the terms of this warning label are violated.

                    <div class="mt-4 font-bold">Quality Control</div>
                    Purchasers and workroom employees should carefully examine material before cutting to verify
                    correct color and pattern. Variations in color cannot be avoided as dye lots often vary. If an exact
                    color match is required, a cutting of the required color should be submitted with the order. We cannot
                    be held responsible for color variations beyond a reasonable commercial match. On "piece" or "full roll"
                    orders, every effort will be made to ship as closely as possible to the required yardage. However, at
                    times, due to piece size, there may be up to a 10% overage. This is an industry standard. We are not
                    responsible for changes in fabric or color which are due to flame-proofing chemical processes requested
                    by the customer.

                    <div class="mt-4 font-bold">Returns and Cancellations</div>
                    No returns will be accepted without a written authorization. All claims must be made within
                        ninety (90) days of receipt of goods. Credit will not be issued unless the fabric is received on our
                        premises within thirty (30) days from the date of the written return authorization. Anything
                        returned must be in sellable condition, uncut and unprocessed. We cannot accept cancellations or
                        returns of orders for fabrics that have been phased-out, closed-out, or products treated with any
                        special finishes such as flame proofing, paper backing, acrylic backing, vinyl or stain-repellent
                        finishes or customs. Returns or cancellations will not be accepted on direct fabrics. Please see
                        additional LoomSource policies below. Credit will be allowed on authorized returns as follows:
                    <ul class="about_bullets">
                        <li>Cuts of less than 5 yards-NO CREDIT</li>

                    </ul>
                    If your order has been cut and packed, and is either ready for shipment or has left our premises,
                    cancellation cannot be accepted.

                    <em>Standard</em><br>
                    All Momentum Group’s products are produced to meet or exceed ACT (Association for Contract Textiles)
                    quality and performance standards. A continuing guarantee under the Textile Fiber Products
                    Identification Act is filed with the Federal Trade Commission. Additional fabric finishes applied to
                    Momentum Group products after purchase will void any Momentum Group warranty.
                    <p class="mt-2">We guarantee our fabric will perform in accordance with generally accepted industry standards when
                        used under normal conditions and for the purpose intended for a period of three (3) years from date
                        of purchase. High-abrasion fabrics (greater than 50,000 double rubs), we guarantee will perform for
                        a period of five (5) years from the date of purchase. Our EPU coated products, we guarantee will
                        perform for a period of ten (10) years from date of purchase. Our Silica products, we guarantee will
                        perform for a period of fifteen (15) years from date of purchase.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2">In the unlikely event that one of our products does not perform to commercial standards, when
                        specified for the purpose intended, properly installed, used in a “single-shift” environment and
                        maintained under normal conditions using appropriate cleaning agents and methods, Momentum Group
                        will replace said fabrics free of charge, but will not be responsible for any labor costs.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2"><em>Coated Fabrics</em><br>
                        Certain clothing and accessory dyes (such as those used on denim jeans) may migrate to lighter
                        colors. This phenomenon is increased by humidity and temperature and is irreversible. Momentum Group
                        will not assume responsibility for dye transfer caused by external contaminants.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2"><em>Wallcovering</em><br>
                        Momentum Textiles, LLC warrants to Customer that the Products sold by Momentum Textiles will be free

                    MOMENTUM TEXTILES INCLUDES AN INSTALLATION INSTRUCTION AND CARE SHEET WITH EACH ROLL OF WALLCOVERING
                    SOLD. Warranty coverage is subject to the condition that all Momentum Textiles instructions for
                    installation and care of the Products are followed. IF THE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTION AND CARE SHEET DOES
                    NOT ACCOMPANY ANY PRODUCTS SOLD BY OR FOR MOMENTUM TEXTILES, LLC CONTACT MOMENTUM TEXTILES BEFORE

                    In the event Momentum Textiles, LLC determines that any Product supplied by Momentum Textiles does not
                    meet any warranty, Momentum Textiles, LLC will replace each such Product or (at Momentum Textiles’
                    option) shall refund the net purchase price (after cash and other discounts). All warranty claims are
                    subject to prorated charges for any service rendered during the warranty period.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2">
                    No warranty claim will be allowed by Momentum Textiles with respect to any Product purchased for further
                    processing unless Momentum Textiles is notified of any alleged defect within 30 days after delivery to
                    Customer and Momentum Textiles is provided with reasonable opportunity to examine the Product before its
                    use or further processing. This warranty is subject to the further conditions that Customer notifies

                    <p class="mt-2">
                    Warranty coverage does not include any defect or performance deficiency which is the direct or indirect
                    result, in whole or in part, of accident, abuse, misuse, vandalism, or other damage or alteration of the

                    of Momentum Textiles, LLC. Furthermore, warranty coverage does not extend to any defect in the

                    conditions exceeding those recommended by Momentum Textiles or generally accepted by industry for the

                        Due to the inherent nature of acrylic fiber used in Sunbrella® patterns, pilling or fuzzing may
                        initally occur. This may be removed with a sweater shaver. Pills will eventually break off with wear
                        or washing.</p>

                    <div class="mt-4 font-bold">Testing Information/ Certificates</div>
                    Flame retardant certificates, as well as copies of actual test reports (i.e., abrasion, wearability,
                    fire rating) are available, where applicable, upon request.

                    <div class="mt-4 font-bold">Pattern Repeat Advisory</div>
                    Pattern repeats will vary slightly. Those shown on this website and in our sample books are
                        approximate only. To avoid possible shortages, allowances should be made whenever a pattern repeat
                        is involved.

                    <div class="mt-4 font-bold">Reserve Policy</div>
                    WEEK 1 (FIRST RESERVE): Momentum Group is happy to reserve the exact amount of yardage needed
                        for a potential order for a period of one week (7 calendar days). During this period of time, the
                        customer does not have to give up this yardage for any reason, unless they so choose.<br>
                        <br>
                        WEEK 2 (SECOND RESERVE): In cases where one week is not enough time for a purchase order to take
                        place, Momentum Group will reserve the yardage for a second week (another 7 calendar days). However,
                        during the second reserve, if another customer has a purchase order for the same product, the first
                        customer with the product on reserve will have 48 hours to submit a purchase order. If the first
                        customer's purchase order is not received in within 48 hours, they will have to surrender the
                        yardage to the second customer.

                    <div class="mt-4 font-bold">Custom Terms &amp; Conditions</div>
                Because custom products are not from our standard line, a 50% deposit is required when an order is
                    placed.
